        <p> My name is Jorge and tech has always been a passion of mine. I always loved the concept and items that bring us the most fun
            but a part of me feels weird because I also want to know how it all works to make my own product! I need my skills to get better, all I know is basics
            and good ol' "tutorial hell"
        </p>
        <p>I plan on becoming one with the computer!</p>
